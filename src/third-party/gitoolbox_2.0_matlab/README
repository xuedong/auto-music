=====================================================

GIToolbox is a grammatical inference toolbox in Matlab. 
It provides useful implementations of some grammatical algorithms.
e.g., RPNI, EDSM, K-testable, Alergia, MDI, OSTIA

This toolbox doesn't need any installation, the only requirement is that 
you should already install Matlab of any version on your local machine. Or
you can install Octave (an alternative open source scientific computing platform).
You can find documentions on our website. 

Algorithms included
