% [Description]
% LEXCALCMP: string comparison (by lexical order or dictionary order)
%
% If S1 and S2 are strings, LEXCMP(S1,S2) returns:
%    -1,  S1 < S2
%     0,  S1 = S2
%     1,  S1 > S2
% where S1 and S2 are compared on the lexical order;
% S1 and S2 are strings or character arrays
%
%	See also STRCMP, STRCMPC.

function c = LEXICALCMP(s1,s2)
    L=min(numel(s1),numel(s2));
    c=0;
    i=1;
    % find the first place where the strings differ
    while (c==0)&&(i<=L),
        c=sign(s1(i)-s2(i));
        i=i+1;
    end;

    if c==0,
    % strings agree so far compare on lengths
        c=sign(numel(s1)-numel(s2));
