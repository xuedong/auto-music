% [Description]
% Merge a red state with a blue state
% Input: A DFFA, a red state and a blue state
% Output: A updated Deterministic Frequency Finite Automaton (DFFA)
% see also MDIStochasticFold, MDICompatible, MDIScore, MDIPromote

function dffa = MDIStochasticMerge(dffa, qr, qb)
%This method is used to merge a red state with a blue state
    % find the only predecessor of the blue state qb
    atm = dffa.AssociateTransitionMatrix;
    for i = 1:length(dffa.Alphabets)
        % alph = dffa.Alphabets(i);
        q = find(atm(:,i) == qb);   % predecessor of the blue state qb
        if (q)   % (q, i) -> qb
            break;
        end
    end
    % record the frequency
    freq = dffa.FrequencyTransitionMatrix{2}(q, i);
    % redirect to the red state qr
    dffa.FrequencyTransitionMatrix{1}(q, i) = qr;
    dffa.AssociateTransitionMatrix(q, i) = qr;
    %new_dffa = dffa;
    dffa = MDIStochasticFold(dffa, qr, qb);
