% [Description]
% This method will merge two states
% input: the dfa, state q1 and q2 to be merged, q1 is a member of RED and q2
% is a member of BLUE
% output: the updated DFA
% 
% First of all, we find out the precedessor(q_f) of BLUE state(q2),
% according to the principle of RPNI, this precedessor is unique.
% And then set the transition (q_f, a) as the RED state(q1).
% After operations above, a tree rooted at q2 will be isolated from DFA.
% Then we call EDSM_FOLD to concatenate this tree onto current DFA.
% EDSM_MERGE returns an updated DFA.
% see also EDSM_FOLD

function dfa = EDSM_MERGE(dfa, q1, q2)
    % first find a (q_f, a) such that del(q_f, a)<--q2
    for i = 1:length(dfa.Alphabets)    
            q_f = GetSourceState(dfa, q2, dfa.Alphabets(i));
            a = dfa.Alphabets(i);
            if(q_f~=0)
               break; 
            end       
    end
    if(length(q_f)>1)
        display(q_f);
    end
    % Set the transition (q_f, a) as q1
    dfa = SetTransition(dfa, q_f, a, q1);  

    dfa = EDSM_FOLD(dfa, q1, q2);
