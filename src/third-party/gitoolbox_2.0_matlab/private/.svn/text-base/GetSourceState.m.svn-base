% --------------------------
% this is an auxiliary function that return the source state of a
% trantition, i.e., if there is a transition q1 ->(a) q2, given q2 and 'a' as input it
% will return q1, independent of the alphabet that causes that transition.
% in case of multiple sources it shows an error that PTA of the RPNI
% algorithm has not been constructed accurately
% input: DFA, destination state q2, 'a' is the alpahbet
% output: source state q1. A 0 is returned if no source exist

function q1 = GetSourceState(dfa, q2, a)
    q1 = 0; 
    col =  find(strcmp(dfa.Alphabets, a));
  
    array = dfa.TransitionMatrix(:,col);
    
    q1 = find(array==q2);
    
%   needs clarification
    if(length(q1)>1)
        display('double');
        q1 = q1(1);
    end
