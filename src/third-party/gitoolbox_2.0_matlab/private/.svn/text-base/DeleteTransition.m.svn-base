% this is an auxiliary function that deletes the
% trantition of a state q for alphabet 'a' in the Transition Matrix
% input: DFA, source state q, 'a' is the alpahbet
% output: updated DFA

function dfa = DeleteTransition(dfa, q, a)
%    col_position =  find(ismember(dfa.Alphabets, a), 1);
%    row_position = find(ismember(dfa.FiniteSetOfStates, q), 1);
     col_position =  find(strcmp(dfa.Alphabets, a));
     row_position = find(dfa.FiniteSetOfStates == q);
     dfa.TransitionMatrix(row_position, col_position) = 0;
