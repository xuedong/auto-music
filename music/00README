This is a small corpus of strings that represent melodies belonging to
three different music styles: Gregorian, Bach and Scott Joplin.
100 melodies of each style have been collected and represented in
several string formats:  explicit, implicit and diferential.
Explicit notation represents each musical note as a substring of
identical symbols, where each simbol represent the pitch and the
duration or length is explicitly represented by the number of symbols
in the substring.  Implicit notation represnts each note as a word
composed of two (or more) elemental symbols, the first of which represents
the pitch and the remaining ones the duration in terms of standard
score notation.  Differential notation, finally is similar to implicit
notation, except for the pitch, which is represented in a "differential"
manner; i.e., each symbol stands for the difference from the previous
note pitch to that of the current one.
