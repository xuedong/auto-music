Directory "diferencial" contains samples coded with "differential notation".
There are samples from different musical styles, organized in directories named
as:

- /bach  (100 melodies from Johann Sebastian Bach). --> Archive "bachdif.all"
- /scot  (100 melodies from Scott Joplin).          --> Archive "scotdif.all"
- /grego (100 melodies from Gregorian Chant).       --> Archive "gregdif.all"

The order from samples in these archives is the same order they where
collected, and contiguous ones usually belong to the same musical piece. This
is why they where reordered randomly and placed in next directory called:

- /randomOrder   --> Contains the above three archives with the melodies in
                     random order. These archives have been renamed as:
                     * bachdifRnd.all
                     * gredifRnd.all
                     * scotdifRnd.all

- /splitAlphabet --> Contains the same samples coded in a slightly different
way, called "splitted differential notation" . Here "differential coding" is
splitted separating characters that code the pitch from characters coding the
length from musical notes. The archives have been renamed as:
                     * bachdifSpl.all
                     * gredifSpl.all
                     * scotdifSpl.all
                     * doSplit (converts differential to splitted notation)
                     - /randomOrder --> Contains the above three archives with
                       the melodies in random order. Archives renamed as:
                                       * bachdifSplRnd.all 
                                       * gredifSplRnd.all
                                       * scotdifSplRnd.all
